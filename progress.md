# Progress: Desktop CPU Batch OCR Evaluation

## 2026-05-21
- Started batch desktop CPU throughput/accuracy evaluation work.
- Added tests for PaddleOCR CTC decoding, throughput summary, model output layout selection, and PaddleOCR metadata parsing.
- Implemented PaddleOCR ONNX evaluation, batch throughput measurement, and candidate config metadata paths.
- Fixed a LightSVTR regression caused by treating `[time,batch,class]` output as `[batch,time,class]`.
- Ran all Python tests: `pixi run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` passed 23 tests.
- Ran full CPU batch report with TrOCR imported predictions:
  `/tmp/medlog_bare_benchmark/candidate_results_cpu_batch_with_trocr.json`
  and `/tmp/medlog_bare_benchmark/candidate_results_cpu_batch_with_trocr.txt`.
